Nerve con- duction studies revealed carpal tunnel syndrome and mild sensory axonopathy of the sural nerve (Table). \nAnti-PGP9.5 antibody staining of a skin biopsy specimen revealed reduced intra-epidermal nerve fiber density (Figure D).\nAn electrocardiogram indicated low voltage and first- degree atrioventricular block. \nEchocardiography showed concentric ventricular hypertrophy, atrial dilatation, and dystelectasis (aortic diameter: 35.1 mm, mean left atrial diameter: 50.8 mm, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter at end-diastole: 41.4 mm, interventricular septal thickness: 15.1 mm, posterior wall thickness: 15.2 mm, fractional shorten- ing: 40%, E/e’: 18.3), with a granular sparkling pattern (Figure A).\n123I-MIBG myocardial scintigraphy revealed a de- creased early heart to mediastinum (H/M) ratio (1.79, normal range: 2.2-4.0), a decreased late H/M ratio (1.34, normal range: 2.2-4.4), and an increased washout rate (62.7%, normal range: 0-34%), which suggested not only heart failure but also cardiac sympathetic fiber dysfunction (12). 99mTc-pyrophosphate myocardial scintigraphy showed in- creased 99mTc-pyrophosphate accumulation in the heart (Figure B). \nCardiac magnetic resonance imaging with non- contrast T1 mapping revealed a markedly elevated myocardial native T1 value, which suggested cardiac involvement by amyloidosis (Figure C). \nMatrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) of serum TTR re- vealed a low peak of variant TTR with a reduced mass (by 76 Da), in addition to a markedly high wild-type TTR peak (Figure E). \nWe performed a duodenal mucosa biopsy that showed ATTR amyloid deposition.

Local hospital laboratory findings revealed MAHA and AKI. Based on family history, aHUS had been suspected and the patient was referred to the Department of Transplantation Medicine, Nephrology, and Internal Diseases, Medical University of Warsaw. On admission, the patient was conscious, anuric, dialysis-dependent, and hypertensive—his blood pressure was 190/130 mmHg; fever was still present. ADAMTS-13 activity was normal, serum concentration of complement compo- nent 3 (C3) and C4, antinuclear antibodies (ANA), antibodies directed against glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM), anticardiolipin antibodies (ACL) IgG and IgM, and lupus anticoagulant (LA) were within normal limits, LDH 1524 U/L, and serum haptoglobin concentration (HPT) was undetectable. High blood pressure was reduced using standard antihypertensive drugs. Spring-loaded needle kidney biopsy was performed. Two samples of kidney cortex were collected (25 glomeruli) and histopathological examination revealed severe thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) and acute tubular injury; immunofluorescence examination (IFL) showed IgM, complement, and fibrinogen positive staining in the arte- rioles. Based on the kidney biopsy, the TPE session was started immediately. Daily TPE sessions were performed in the morning using FFP as a substitute. Moreover, one unit of FFP was given extra in the evening due to ongoing hemolysis. After 12 TPE sessions, hemolysis was limited, but the patient was still anuric and required hemodialysis. In order to assess further prognosis, the second kidney biopsy was performed 3 weeks later. Two samples were collected—in one sample only necrotic scarring was observed, and in the second sample, the kidney cortex contained 9 glomeruli with slightly active TMA and pro- gression of chronic lesions–chronic ischemic nephropathy; IFL revealed fibrinogen positive staining in arterioles. Next, five TPE sessions were performed with slow improvement in urine output (2000 mL/24 h) with no reduction in SCr. Hematological remission was finally achieved; however, the patient remained dialysis-dependent. Severe course of the disease and the risk of aHUS recurrence kept the patient P2 reluctant to pretransplant assessment, so hemodialysis was continued.",

General malaise and oliguria appeared few days later. Local hospital laboratory findings revealed MAHA and AKI and the patient was referred to the Department of Transplantation Medicine Nephrology, and Internal Diseases, Medical University of Warsaw. On admission, he was in a good general condition. Physical exami- nation found no other abnormalities. ADAMTS-13, C3, and C4 were normal. The panel of antibodies: ACL, LA, ANA, and anti-GBM, were negative. Patient required hemodialysis. During implementation of dialysis, catheter massive bleeding occurred so transfusion of PLT, so FFP and 2 blood units were provided. Due to severe thrombocytopenia and propensity for bleeding, based on clear evidence of family history, kidney biopsy was not taken into consideration. Immediately, daily TPE sessions were started using FFP in the dose of 40 mL/kg as a substitute. Within 2 weeks of treatment, hematological remission was achieved with no renal response. The patient remained dialysis-dependent and was referred to a local dialysis center. Three months later, the patient was admitted again for pretransplant assessment. Despite the risk of aHUS recurrence, he was highly motivated to be accepted as a potential renal transplant recipient. Standard evaluation revealed no absolute contraindications for Ktx. In those days, the crucial problem was in the lack of genetic testing identifying complement abnormalities. Regarding economic reasons, it was not possible to perform it abroad. The patient accepted the risk of aHUS recurrence following kidney transplantation (Ktx). He underwent Ktx from a 60-year-old cadaveric female donor (5 November 2010), and the historical panel reactive antibody (PRA) and PRA prior to Ktx was 0%. In analyzing the immune selection between donor and recipient, three human leucocyte antigen mis-matches (HLA MM) were found. The standard immunosu- pressive regimen was implemented: glucocorticosteroids, tacrolimus, and mycophenolate mofetile (MMF). The immediate graft function was observed. Within the first 3 months, doses of glucocorticosteroids and tacrolimus (through level 5–7 ng/mL) were tempered and SCr stabilized at 1.3 mg/dL. In the third month after Ktx, in protocol graft biopsy, we found no signs of TMA, no acute rejection, and IFL and C4d staining were negative. His uneventful posttransplant outcome made the second brother (P2) encouraged to try Ktx. The P2 underwent Ktx from a 24-year-old cadaveric female donor (9 September 2011), the PRA was 0%, and there were two HLA MM. The immunosupressive regimen consisted of glucocorticosteroids, tacrolimus, MMF, and basiliximab as per center protocol. Immediate graft function was observed with SCr 1 mg/dL within the first few days. Three months later, protocol graft biopsy revealed normal graft structure, no sign of TMA, no acute rejection, and IFL negative. Over the years (until December 2020), both recipients have re- mained stable with no signs of aHUS recurrence. Genetic analysis identifying complement abnormalities was conducted in 2016 when such opportunity occurred. Moreover, the P2 decided to procreate, so to avoid potential teratogenic effect, MMF had been switched into azathioprine three months prior to planned conception. In 2017, a healthy infant was born with no sign of the disease so far. In P3, renal cell carcinoma (RCC) of the native kidney was diagnosed in 2019, so he underwent nephrectomy and nephron-sparing surgery for suspicion of allograft RCC. Histological examination revealed papillary RCC type 1, G1 (Fuhrman) pT1a in native kidney, in allograft—a cyst with no sign of tumor.",

The 10-month-old girl was admitted to the Department of Pediatrics Nephrology, Medical University of Warsaw with clinical features of AKI. The symptoms included diarrhea with 4–5 loose feces per day without blood or mucus and vomiting. On admission, she was in moderate general condition with pale skin and peripheral oedema. Weight on admission was 7530 g (<3 percentile) and that was 730 g more than her estimated dry weight. Physical examination revealed abdominal bloating, hepatomegaly, and severe hypertension (BP 150/90 mmHg). Laboratory tests confirmed MAHA and AKI. Urinal- ysis revealed proteinuria 4894 mg/dL and erythrocyturia. The direct Coombs’ test was negative, decreased C3 was 68.5 mg/dL with normal C4, and the total hemolytic com- plement measurement (CH50) was 18 μEq/mL (range 70–180). The peripheral blood smear revealed anisocytosis with macrocytosis, microspherocytes, schistocytes, rouleaux, and platelets anisocytosis. Normal ADAMTS-13 activity excluded thrombotic throm-bocytopenic purpura (TTP), the fluorescein-labeled proaerolysin (FLAER) test excluded paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), and no warm or cold autoantibodies were found. Concentration of homocysteine and cobalamin were normal. Stool culture was negative. Because of anuria, continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) was initiated (eighteen 24 h long dialysis). Plasma infusions were started (10 mL/kg/day) prior to TPE. Eight TPE sessions were performed and hemolysis was terminated. After the second TPE, transient restitution of diuresis (3 mL/kg/h) was noted; however, three days later, anuria recurred. Five weeks later, the method of renal replacement therapy was changed for peritoneal dialysis. Hemolysis was terminated with no renal improvement. Genetic analysis of complement regulators revealed a combined mutation (Table 1). At that time, eculizumab therapy was not available in Poland.\nIn the third week of hospitalization, pulmonary oedema was observed. Despite solute removal during CVVHDF, no improvement in left ventricular systolic function or decrease in severity of mitral regurgitation was observed. Ejection fraction (EF) remained around 50%, which may indicate direct cardiac involvement.\nIn the following 12 months, the patient had been undergoing peritoneal dialysis and had been nourished by percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (body weight–7.6 kg). The laboratory tests constantly showed PLT 234 G/L, HGB 98 g/L (despite of erythropoietin injections). The patient presented with anuria, LDH 800 IU/mL and persistently low C3 levels. The left ventricular function deteriorated and after a year from the onset of aHUS, the ejection fraction (EF) was 28% (EF Simpson-Method).\nIn 2017, she was vaccinated against meningococcal infection (Men A, C, W-135, Y, and B) and due to severe cardiomyopathy, eculizumab therapy was started (from social donations). Eculizumab blocks the terminal complement alternative pathway (anti-C5 agent) and it is highly effective in complement-mediated TMA. During the first year of eculizumab treatment, a gradual improvement in cardiac EF (% EF Simpson-Method-from 28 to 57%) was observed. In the second year of therapy, a decrease of EF was (50%) observed again and pulmonary hypertension was diagnosed based on cardiac catheterization. Sildenafil was introduced with satisfactory effect. She has not presented cardiovascular insufficiency. Despite a balanced diet and feeding by percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy, her weight gain and height are unsatisfactory (<3c). The patient is currently waiting for Ktx.",

The 4-year-old girl was admitted to the Department of Pediatrics Nephrology with gross hematuria. The symptoms included vomiting, fever, and stomach pain. On admission to the hospital, she was in moderate general condition and physical examination revealed pale skin, petechiae, and middle dehydration. Laboratory tests confirmed MAHA and AKI. Urinalysis revealed proteinuria 1487 mg/dL and erythrocyturia. The direct Coombs’ test was negative, slightly decreased C3 was 68.6 mg/dL with normal C4, and CH50 was 5 μEq/mL (range 70–180). ADAMTS-13 activity and concentration of homocysteine were normal. Shiga toxins was not detected by PCR and stool culture was negative. Due to family history with aHUS, the girl was qualified for the eculizumab treatment program already introduced in 2018. She was vaccinated against meningococcal infection (Men A, C, W-135, Y, and B) and on the third day of hospitalization, the first dose of eculizumab was administered. After a few days, PLT normalized, and decreased renal function parameters and LDH were observed.\nIn the following 18 months, the patient has been undergoing eculizumab therapy, and this treatment is still being continued. P5 is now a healthy girl with normal renal function and normal blood pressure, and no recurrence of HUS has been observed.",
